Peer Discovery
==============

This is a suggestion of a peer discovery prtocol as a way to gradually
move off depending on IRC.

It will be implemented in ElectrumX from version 0.11.0
onwards.


Peer Database
-------------

A persistent store of peers with at least the following information
about a peer so that state persists across server restarts.  This
information is required for a response to the **server.peers.subscribe**
RPC call:

* host name
* ip address
* TCP and SSL port numbers
* protocol version
* pruning limit, if any

At present ElectrumX uses a flat file for this DB in the main database
directory.  It retains additional per-peer metadata including:

* time of last successful connection
* time of last connection attempt
* count of unsuccessful attempts since last successful one
* source of the information stored about this peer


Default Peers
-------------

This is a list of hard-coded, well-known peers to seed the peer
discovery process if the peer database is empty or corrupt.  If the
peer database is available it is not used.  Ideally it should hold up
to 10 servers that have shown commitment to reliable service.

In ElectrumX this is a per-coin property in `lib/coins.py`.


Response to server.peers.subscribe RPC call
-------------------------------------------

This RPC call is used by Electrum clients to get a list of peer
servers, in preference to a hard-coded list of peer servers in the
client, which it will fall back to if necessary.

The response should only include peers it has successfully connected
to recently.  If Tor routing is not available to the server, so it
cannot connect to them, it should return a random limited number of
onion peers it is aware of.

In ElectrumX, "recently" is taken to be the last 24 hours, and it will
serve up to 3 onion peers if onion routing is not available.


Maintaining the Peer Database
-----------------------------

In order to keep its peer database up-to-date and fresh, if some time
has passed since the last successful connection to a peer, an Electrum
server should make an attempt to connect, choosing the TCP or SSL port
at random if both are available.  On connecting it should issue
**server.peers.subscribe** and **server.features** RPC calls to
collect information about the server and its peers, and issue a
**server.add_peer** call to advertise itself.  Once this is done and
replies received it should terminate the connection.

The peer database should prefer information obtained from the peer
itself over information obtained from any other source.

If a connection attempt fails, reconnection should follow some kind of
exponential backoff.  If a long period of time has elapsed since the
successful connection attempt, the peer entry should be removed from
the database.

ElectrumX will choose the SSL port most of the time if both ports are
available.  It tries to reconnect to each peer once every 24 hours and
drops peers if two weeks have passed since a successful connection.


server.features RPC call
------------------------

This is a new RPC call that a server can use to advertise what
services and features it offers.  It is intended for use by Electrum
clients as well as peer servers.  In the case of servers it is useful
in order to have database peer information sourced from the peer
itself.

The call takes no arguments and returns a dictionary keyed by feature
name whose value gives details about the feature where appropriate.
If a key is missing the feature is presumed not to be offered.

Currently ElectrumX understands and returns the following keys:

* **hosts**

  An dictionary, keyed by host name, that this server can be reached
  at.  Normally this will only have a single entry; other entries can
  be used in case there are other connection routes (e.g. ToR).

  The value for a host is itself a dictionary, with the following
  optional keys:

  * **ssl_port**

    An integer.  Omit or set to *null* if SSL connectivity is not
    provided.

  * **tcp_port**

    An integer.  Omit or set to *null* if TCP connectivity is not
    provided.

  A server should ignore information provided about any host other
  than the one it connected to.

* **server_version**

  A string that identifies the server software.  Should be the same as
  the response to **server.version** RPC call.

* **protocol_version**

  A string that is the Electrum protcol version.  Should be the same
  as what would suffix the letter 'v' in the IRC real name.

* **pruning**

  An integer, the pruning limit.  Omit or set to *null* if there is no
  pruning limit.  Should be the same as what would suffix the letter
  'p' in the IRC real name.


server.add_peer RPC call
------------------------

This call is intended for a new server to get itself in the connected
set.

It takes a single parameter (named **features** if JSON RPCv2 named
parameters are being used) which contains the same information as the
**server.features** RPC call would return.

A server receiving a **server.add_peer** call should not replace
existing information about the host(s) given, but instead schedule a
separate connection to verify the information for itself.

To prevent abuse a server may want to ignore excessive calls to this
function.


IRC
---

Other server implementations may not have implemented the peer
discovery protocol yet.  Whilst we transition away from IRC, in order
to keep these servers in the connected peer set, software implementing
this protocol should provide a way to occasionally connect to IRC to
pick up stragglers only advertising themselves there.
